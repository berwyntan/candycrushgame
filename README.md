causing the surrounding pieces of candy to fall into the empty spaces.
Released by King in 2012, it is played by millions around the world.

### How To Play
Players drag a candy to swap its position. A candy can only be swapped if it leads to a match of 3 or more.
The candy can only be swapped with those that are adjacent to it. At the top, bottom, left and right.
If the player runs out of candies to swap, the game is over.
